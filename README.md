# Abstract:

The Problem Based Benchmark Suite (PBBS) is a collection
of benchmark problems defined in terms of I/O specification
with varying algorithms and implementations [1]. This paper
aims to provide a workload characterization of the PBBS
benchmark suite for single-core systems using speculation
in the memory and pipeline. Over a variety of benchmarks,
we contrast prefetcher configurations, and we explore the
performance of branch predictors
